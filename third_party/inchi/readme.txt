This directory contains InChI Software source codes.
It also contains examples of InChI API usage, for C
('inchi_main', 'mol2inchi', 'test_ixa'; see projects
for MS Visual Studio 2008 in 'vc9' and for gcc/Linux
in 'gcc' subdirs) and for Python 3 ('python_sample').

Also supplied are InChI API Library source codes and
related projects/makefiles.
