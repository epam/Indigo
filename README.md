### Bindings in public repositories:
* .NET: <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Indigo.Net>

## Source code organization ##

Main directory structure layout:
* `api`: Indigo API sources
* `bingo`: Bingo sources
* `core`: Core algorithms and data structures sources
* `third_party`: sources for third-party libraries
* `utils`: utilities sources

Each project is placed in the corresponding directory with CMakeList.txt configuration
file, that does not include other projects. In order to build the whole project with the
correct references you need to use CMake configurations from the build_scripts directory.

## Preinstalled build tools ##

To build the project from the sources, the following tools should be installed:

>Required:
* GIT 1.8.2+
* C/C++ compilers with C++14 support (GCC, Clang and MSVC are officially supported)
* CMake 3.4+
* Python 3.6+

>Required to build all targets:
* JDK 1.8+
* .NET Standard 2.0+

>Required to build Indigo-WASM:
* Emscripten SDK
* Ninja

## Build instruction ##

>On Windows use cmd  to run the commands.

1) Create build folder
    ```
    mkdir build
    ```
2) Move to build folder
    ```
    cd build
    ```

2) Run CMake to configure the project with desired options. For instance:
    ```
    cmake .. -DBUILD_INDIGO=ON -DBUILD_INDIGO_WRAPPERS=ON -DBUILD_INDIGO_UTILS=ON
    ```

3) Build Indigo from console:
    ```
    cmake --build . --config Release --target <target name>
    ```

Replace _**\<target name\>**_ with any of the following targets you need:

- **ALL_BUILD** (on Windows)
- **all** (on Linux)
- **indigo-dotnet**
- **indigo-java**
- **indigo-python**

> Build results could be collected from Indigo/dist folder.

> 'indigo-python' target is commonly used.

## Run tests ##
Befor running any test you have to build and install indigo-python

1) Build indigo-python using `--target indigo-python` or `--target ALL_BUILD`(on Windows) or `--target all`(on Linux). See Build instruction above.
    > - On Windows the package should be in 'Indigo/api/python/dist' folder
    > - On Linux it is located in 'Indigo\dist' folder


> Package will be named like 'epam.indigo-*\<version-arch\>*.whl'. For instance: *epam.indigo-1.29.0.dev2-py3-none-win_amd64.whl*
   
2) Install package using pip
    > - If Indigo package has been already installed, uninstall it with the following command: `python -m pip uninstall <path-to-.whl-file> -y`

    ```
    python -m pip install <path-to-.whl-file>
    ```
    
    > Replace _**\<path-to-.whl-file>**_ with the right path to .whl package. For instance: `python -m pip install ../api/python/dist/epam.indigo-1.29.0.dev2-py3-none-win_amd64.whl`

3) Run integration test

    >to run all test

    ```
    python api/tests/integration/test.py -t 1
    ```
    
    >to run tests by mask use `test_name`
    ```
    python api/tests/integration/test.py -t 1 -p test_name
    ```

### To run backend API test:
1) Build and install indigo-python
2) Set environment variable by running this command:

    > for Linux
    ```
    export INDIGO_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5000/v2
    ```
    > for Windows in PowerShell
    ```
    $env:INDIGO_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:5000/v2"
    ```
3) Run backend service :
    ```
    cd utils/indigo-service/backend/service
    ```
    ```
    cp v2/common/config.py .
    ```
    ```
    waitress-serve --listen="127.0.0.1:5000 [::1]:5000"  app:app
    ```
    > you may use any port instead of 5000

4) Run backend API test:
    ```
    python utils/indigo-service/backend/service/tests/api/indigo_test.py`
    ```
    > use `-k test_name` to run test by pattern.

## How to build Indigo-WASM ##

### Build tools prerequisites ###

* Git

Make sure git is running from path:
```
>git --version
git version 2.26.2.windows.1
```

* Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Make sure python is running from path:
```
>python --version
Python 3.9.0
```

* cmake (https://cmake.org/download/)

Make sure cmake is running from path:
```
>cmake --version
cmake version 3.18.4
```

* Install ninja (https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases)

Download corresponding ninja-xxx.zip and unpack to folder on path.
Make sure it's running from path:
```
>ninja --version
1.10.2
```

* Install emscripten sdk (https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk)

```
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
```
```
cd emsdk
```
```
./emsdk install latest
```

```
./emsdk activate latest
```
```
source ./emsdk_env.sh
```

Note: On Windows, run `emsdk` instead of `./emsdk`, and `emsdk_env.bat` instead of source `./emsdk_env.sh`, use `cmd` instead of `powershell`.

### Get Indigo sources ###

Clone (or checkout) Indigo repository

```
>git clone https://github.com/epam/Indigo.git
```

### Build Indigo ###

For each new session, set environment anew:
```
>cd emsdk
>./emsdk activate latest
```

If fresh build:
```
>mkdir build
>cd build
```

Now build:
```
>emcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G Ninja
>ninja indigo-ketcher-js-test
```


## How to build conda package ##

Prepare conda build environment as described at https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/install-conda-build.html
Change directory to ```recipe-conda``, set INDIGO_VERSION to existing Indigo version(already published at PyPi), run conda build:
Linux/Mac:
```
>cd conda-recipe
>INDIGO_VERSION=1.29.0 conda build . 
```

Windows(using cmd):
```
>cd conda-recipe
>set INDIGO_VERSION=1.29.0 
>conda build . 
```

To upload packages: install anaconda-client, login, and upload packet using command provided by conda-build in output
```
>conda install anaconda-client
>anaconda login
Enter username:
Enter password:
>anaconda upload /conda-build-dir/packet-name
```
