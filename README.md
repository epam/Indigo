Main directory structure layout:
 * api: Indigo API sources
 * bingo: Bingo sources
 * build_scripts: CMake and python scripts for building all the sources
 * third_party: sources for third-party libraries
 * utils: utilities sources
 * common|graph|layout|molecule|reaction|render2d: indigo-core sources

## Source code organization ##

Each project is placed in the corresponding directory with CMakeList.txt configuration
file, that does not include other projects. In order to build the whole project with the
correct references you need to use CMake configurations from the build_scripts directory.

## Build instructions ##

All the cmake projects are placed in build_scripts directories. You can use them manually,
or execute preconfigured scripts that does all the job.

## Bingo build instructions ##

To generate project configuration, build the source code, and create the archives for
installation you need to execute build_scripts\bingo-release.py:

	build_scripts\bingo-release.py --preset=linux32 --dbms=[postgres|oracle|sqlserver]

The are different cmake presets:
	linux32, linux64, win32, win64, mac10.7 (and also all later mac10.x versions)

## Indigo build instructions ##

To generate project configuration, build the source code, and create the archives for
installation you need to execute build_scripts\indigo-release-libs.py and
build_scripts\indigo-release-utils.py:


### Linux (GCC 4.9+ or Clang 3.5+)
	Apt Reqirements:
        sudo apt install cmake libfreetype6-dev libxft-dev
        sudo ldconfig	

	build_scripts/indigo-release-libs.py --preset=linux64
	build_scripts/indigo-release-utils.py --preset=linux64

### Windows (Microsoft Visual Studio 2013+ or MinGW with GCC version 4.9+)

	build_scripts\indigo-release-libs.py --preset=win64-2013
	build_scripts\indigo-release-utils.py --preset=win64-2013

### Mac OS (Clang 3.5+)

	build_scripts/indigo-release-libs.py --preset=mac10.12
	build_scripts/indigo-release-utils.py --preset=mac10.102

### Other

There are different cmake presets:
	win32-2013, win64-2013, win32-2015, win64-2015, win32-mingw, linux32, linux32-universal, linux64,
	linux64-universal, mac10.7, mac10.8, mac10.9, mac10.10, mac10.11, mac10.12

### Wrappers

To generate Java, C#, or Python wrappers after build the binaries you need to execute

    build_scripts\indigo-make-by-libs.py --type=java

Available types: java, dotnet, python
